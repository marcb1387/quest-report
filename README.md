**Install Steps**
```
cp config.ini.example config.ini
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

**Optional Pokemon Filter**

Pokemon filters can be in an area.ini file or config.ini file. Takes 3 digit pokedex numbers to display only those pokemon. If left empty all pokemon encounters will be displayed. An area.ini file will surpass the config.ini file for any settings including a blank dex_number list. If this is not needed it can be commented out in the area.ini file for the config.ini values to be used.

**config.ini File Edits**

You can edit the config.ini file to pick which items you would want in your report with true/false statements. You can also adjust the stardust for research. Stardust amounts will show anything Greater then and equal to the amount you enter.

A Community Ad can be added to the end of the report see below for example. This will accept any text and Discord markdown for links/formatting for up to 2048 characters. If you do not wish to have an ad you can leave the ```Ad_Body``` blank and none will be added. This is effective in both Quest and Rocket leaders reports. If you have different Areas you can enter seprate Ad's for each area by entering the [AD] config into you area.ini file.
